For Day 06; North Pole prototype suit manufacturing lab now, and we must avoid the guard.

TL;DR A guard walking around, can we make them get stuck in loops?

For part 1, we're simulating the guard walking around the obstacles, eventually he goes off the screen, and we count the unique locations they end up in.
For part 2, we want to find where we can add new obstacles that would cause the guard to get stuck in a loop.
