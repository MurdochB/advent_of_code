For Day 07; We cross a familiar bridge, but it needs some repairs.

Missing operators.
TL;DR We are given a number, and a list of numbers with missing operators. We need to find the numbers that are possible to make.

For part 1, we can use only + and * operators. Looping through each line, we can split out the resultant and the operands.
 next we can try all possible combinations of operands to find the lines that are possible.
For part 2, there is another operator | which appends the next number. We can just simply add this to the list of possible operators to check.
