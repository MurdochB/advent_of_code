Finding the peaks.


For day 09;  We get to the roof of a top-secret Easter Bunny installation & notice a huge Antenna.

TL;DR Disk de-fragging.

For part 1, I can make use of my Direction class to work out where the antinodes will be. For example if point A -> B is +5 north & +6 east - I can use that direction to find the antinode (as B + that direction).
For part 2, the antinodes now extend along their path indefinitely, so I can just repeat the process above until the antinodes are out of bounds.
