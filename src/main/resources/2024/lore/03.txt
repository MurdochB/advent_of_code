For Day 03; We go to a Toboggan rental shop, and they're having some computer trouble.

Here we are going to make use of regex. We're looking for anything that looks like mul(x,y) in a big string of random memory.

For part 1, we just find all the mul(x,y) in the input, and add all the results of the multiplications.
For part 2, we also need to look out for do() and don't() - which enables or disables the 'adding up' we are doing.
I can add the do and don't commands to my regex, switching a flag if I need to add the multiplications or not.
