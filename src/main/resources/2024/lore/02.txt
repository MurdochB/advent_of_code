For Day 02; We head over to the red-nosed reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant.

TL;DR List of numbers which must increase or decrease by a set amount - making them 'safe'.

We get a list of reports which contain levels. We are given some rules that mean reports are safe:
- The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
- Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.

For part 1, we just implement the requirements above.
We can check if the first two levels are increasing or decreasing and set a flag that means the report must continue in that fashion.
We can also check that each step changes between 1 and 3 steps.

For part 2, we can now safely tolerate a single bad level.
I create a list of 'potential' reports, each removing one level - and tries them all. If any pass, that report is safe.
